# Text-Mining-Project

Final project for the course Text mining (732A92) of Link√∂ping University

# Abstract
Wine sensory examination and assessment is not easy, even with a wine specialist. However, the description printed on each bottle can bring us some helpful information. Based on that ideal, I decided to analyze the data about wine review (taken form Kaggle) and help the consumers make the decision on two different aspects. The first one is distinguish good and excellent wine. The second aspect is investigating the finance beneficial bottle (high value with an acceptable amount of money). Different natural language processing techniques are applied to process the text data. Then I compare Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM) Linear and SVM RBF kernels when building the best model for predicting. After the best kernel is selected, n-gram and Part-Of-Speech Tagger are used to improve the model. The final results are quite impressive with accuracy 78.69% for the first issue and 77.09% for the second one. Based on these models, some suggestions are provided for the consumers to choose satisfied bottles.
